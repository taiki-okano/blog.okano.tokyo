There is a famous text on Python.
If you type `import this` on the interpreter, you get something like this:

```
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

This states the principal and philosophy of Python or programming.
It also reminds me of a book ["The UNIX philosphy"](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/the-unix-philosophy/gancarz/978-0-08-094819-5) I read a while ago.
And, it also made me think, what would be the translation of this.
I can imagine translating this to other European languages, such as German, would not be complicated at all.
But, when it comes to Japanese, it is totally a different story.
Of course, I can translate word by word, but it would make this utterly ugly.
You need a deep understanding of the original and its context to accurately translate it into a language rooted in a completely different culture.
I ended up in a translation below.

```
>>> import this
Time Peters著 Pythonの真髄

醜いものより美しいものが良い。
暗黙的なものよりも明示的なものが良い。
ただ、もっとひどくなるならそのままで良い。
ネストよりもフラットなコードが良い。
コードの読みやすさは大切だ。
例外だからと言って決まりを破ってはいけない。
しかし、一貫性よりも実用性のほうが大切だ。
エラーは暗黙的に処理されてはならない。
そうするように明示されている場合を除いては。
曖昧なものに対して推測をしたくなるものだがそうしてはならない。
解決策は、一つ、できればそれだけの、わかりやすいものがあるべきだ。
もっとも、オランダ人でなければ最初は見逃してしまうかもしれないが。
物事はやらないよりも遅くてもやったほうが良い。
しかし、今すぐにやるならやらないほうが良いことも多々ある。
なぜ動くか説明できないなら、やり方からして間違っている。
それが説明できるなら、正しいことをしているのかもしれない。
名前空間はとても素晴らしい概念だ。もっと多く使われるべきだ。
```

I tried not to kill the beauty of the original, and make it natural in Japanese too.
ChatGPT seemed to like it, but it also said *interpreting the philosophy of Python from a new perspective*.
In the end, it is about the balance between *respecting the originals and expressing it with easy words for readers* (by ChatGPT).
In case you do not understand Japanese, I translate it to English again. (word by word to show how different it is.)

```
>>> import this
The Spirit of Python, by Time Peters

Beautiful things are better than ugly things.
Explicit things are better than implicit things.
However, if it gets worse, let it unchanged.
Flat code is better than nested.
The readability of code is important.
You cannot break the rule just because it is an exception.
However, the practicality is more important than the purity.
Errors must not be processed implicitly.
Except it is made explicit to do so.
For ambiguous things, you often want to guess, but do not do so.
The solution should be one, and preferably just one, and it needs to be obvious.
However, you might miss it in the beginning unless you are Dutch.
For things, you better do it lately than never.
Although, there are many things you should not do if you are to do it right now.
If you cannot explain how it works, even your methodology is wrong.
If you can explain that, you might do things rightly.
Namespace is a great idea. It should be used more often.
```

My favourite is `However, if it gets worse, let it unchanged.`.
Translation is difficult.
I have gained respects to those doing this for their jobs.
