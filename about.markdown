# About

This is a blog of Taiki, who is currently studying computer science in Germany.

I grew up in Tokyo with the Korean roots, and decided to go outside of Japan at the age of 20 years old.

I have lived in Japan, Germany, and Korea so far. I like traveling, computers, and Formula 1.

I want to share my life or some computer stuffs here.
