# About

This is a blog of Taiki, who is currently studying computer science in Germany.

I grew up in Tokyo for the most of my life and decided to go outside of Japan in 2021.

I have lived in Japan, Germany, and Korea so far.

I like traveling, computers, and Formula 1.

I want to share my life or some computer stuffs here.
